# Development Progress

## 2026-05-06T08:42:41Z - Project kickoff

- Read `doc/USER_REQUIREMENTS.md` in full.
- Read required `doc/REQUIREMENTS.md` sections: 0, 1, 2, 3, 3.3, 9, Appendix A, Appendix B.
- Read Phase 01 requirement sections: 4.1 and 4.15.
- Created `dev_memory/` and Phase 01 memory scaffold.
- Started Phase 01 / Subtask 1.1: config parsing and Pydantic schema.
- Startup observation: workspace did not initially contain a Git repository, which affects the required diff and commit workflow.
- Initialized a local Git repository to satisfy the required patch and commit workflow.

Next action: commit the kickoff baseline, then implement Phase 01 / Subtask 1.1.

## 2026-05-06T08:54:12Z - Phase 01 / Subtask 1.1 completed

- Implemented Python project skeleton, config schema, and safe YAML config loading.
- Added 18 pytest cases covering documented config fields, Appendix B defaults, invalid enums, conflict checks, safe YAML loading, and safety flags.
- Targeted UT passed: `uv --native-tls run --extra dev pytest tests/test_config.py -v` -> 18 passed.
- Full UT passed: `uv --native-tls run --extra dev pytest -v` -> 18 passed.
- Self review completed and recorded in `dev_memory/phases/phase_01_config_init/REVIEW_NOTES.md`.
- Patch files generated under `dev_memory/phases/phase_01_config_init/patches/01_config_schema.*`.

Next action: Phase 01 / Subtask 1.2, module registry validation and namespace computation.
